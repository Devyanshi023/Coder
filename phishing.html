          <div class="topic">Easy-peasy Protection is in your Hands!! </div><br>
          <p>Here are 10 simple tips for identifying and preventing phishing scams.</p><br><br>

          <div class="topic">1. Know what a phishing scam looks like</div>
          <p>New phishing attack methods are being developed all the time, but they share commonalities that can be
            identified if you know what to look for. There are many sites online that will keep you informed of the
            latest phishing attacks and their key identifiers. The earlier you find out about the latest attack methods
            and share them with your users through regular security awareness training, the more likely you are to avoid
            a potential attack.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">2. Don’t click on that link</div>
          <p>It’s generally not advisable to click on a link in an email or instant message, even if you know the
            sender.
            The bare minimum you should be doing is hovering over the link to see if the destination is the correct one.
            Some phishing attacks are fairly sophisticated, and the destination URL can look like a carbon copy of the
            genuine site, set up to record keystrokes or steal login/credit card information. If it’s possible for you
            to
            go straight to the site through your search engine, rather than click on the link, then you should do so.
          </p><br>

          <div class="topic">3. Get free anti-phishing add-ons</div>
          <p>Most browsers nowadays will enable you to download add-ons that spot the signs of a malicious website or
            alert
            you about known phishing sites. They are usually completely free so there’s no reason not to have this
            installed on every device in your organization.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">4. Don’t give your information to an unsecured site</div>
          <p>If the URL of the website doesn’t start with “https”, or you cannot see a closed padlock icon next to the
            URL,
            do not enter any sensitive information or download files from that site. Sites without security certificates
            may not be intended for phishing scams, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">5. Rotate passwords regularly</div>
          <p>If you’ve got online accounts, you should get into the habit of regularly rotating your passwords so that
            you
            prevent an attacker from gaining unlimited access. Your accounts may have been compromised without you
            knowing, so adding that extra layer of protection through password rotation can prevent ongoing attacks and
            lock out potential attackers.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">6. Don’t ignore those updates</div>
          <p>Receiving numerous update messages can be frustrating, and it can be tempting to put them off or ignore
            them
            altogether. Don’t do this. Security patches and updates are released for a reason, most commonly to keep up
            to
            date with modern cyber-attack methods by patching holes in security. If you don’t update your browser, you
            could be at risk of phishing attacks through known vulnerabilities that could have been easily avoided.</p>
          <br>

          <div class="topic">7. Install firewalls</div>
          <p>Firewalls are an effective way to prevent external attacks, acting as a shield between your computer and an
            attacker. Both desktop firewalls and network firewalls, when used together, can bolster your security and
            reduce the chances of a hacker infiltrating your environment.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">8. Don’t be tempted by those pop-ups</div>
          <p>Pop-ups aren’t just irritating; they are often linked to malware as part of attempted phishing attacks.
            Most
            browsers now allow you to download and install free ad-blocker software that will automatically block most
            of
            the malicious pop-ups. If one does manage to evade the ad-blocker though, don’t be tempted to click!
            Occasionally pop-ups will try and deceive you with where the “Close” button is, so always try and look for
            an
            “x” in one of the corners.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">9. Don’t give out important information unless you must</div>
          <p>As a general rule of thumb, unless you 100% trust the site you are on, you should not willingly give out
            your
            card information. Make sure, if you have to provide your information, that you verify the website is
            genuine,
            that the company is real and that the site itself is secure.</p><br>

          <div class="topic">10. Have a Data Security Platform to spot signs of an attack</div>
          <p>If you are unfortunate enough to be the victim of a successful phishing attack, then it’s important you are
            able to detect and react in a timely manner. Having a data security platform in place helps take some of the
            pressure off the IT/Security team by automatically alerting on anomalous user behavior and unwanted changes
            to
            files. If an attacker has access to your sensitive information, data security platforms can help to identify
            the affected account so that you can take action to prevent further damage.</p><br>
